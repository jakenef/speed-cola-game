# Speed Cola Click Test

[My Notes](notes.md)

In the popular Call of Duty: Black Ops franchise, players can drink "Speed-Cola" to increase their speed. This application will test users' reaction times in a game where they must click the screen as soon as it changes colors. The user will repeat the game three times to get an average reaction time at which point they can add their score to the global leaderboard if signed in. If they are fast enough, they will be given a message saying they have the Speed Cola perk!


## ðŸš€ Specification Deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [x] Description of key features
- [x] Description of how you will use each technology
- [x] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

Fuel your reflexes with the Speed Cola Click Test, the ultimate reaction-speed challenge! Inspired by the iconic perk from Call of Duty: Black Ops Zombies that speeds up the player, this website will put your reflexes to the test and measure your reaction time. In three attempts, you will click the screen when it changes color and you will be given an average reaction time and a place in the global leaderboard. If you are fast enough, you can prove that you have the Speed Cola perk in real life!

Here is a diagram for how the backend will store scores and display them to the user.

    You->>Server: Your reflex time
    Friend->>Server: Friend reflex time
    Server-->>Friend: Leaderboard for reflex times
    Server-->>You: Leaderboard for reflex times
```

### Key features

- Tracks exact reflex time down to milliseconds
- Leaderboard scores and personal bests are persistently stored
- Secure login system
- Real-time notifications to all users when someone places on the leaderboard

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Uses correct HTML structure for web application. Four HTML pages, one for login, one to play, one about page, and one to view the leaderboard.
- **CSS** - Website styling that maintains functionality across different screen sizes and devices. Uses good spacing, color choices that resemble the theme of Speed Cola and good contrast.
- **React** - React handles the login, calculating average reaction times, displaying the leaderboard, routing, and components.
- **Service** - Backend service with endpoints for:
  - login
  - retrieving scores
  - submitting scores
  - Third-party API for logging what city a user is playing from (using IP address), which will be logged with their high score and broadcasted when they place on the leaderboard.
- **DB/Login** - Store users, personal bests, and leaderboard scores in database. Register and login users. Credentials securely stored in database. Can't place on leaderboard unless authenticated.
- **WebSocket** - As any user places on the leaderboard, their name is broadcast to other players.

## ðŸš€ AWS deliverable

- [x] **Server deployed and accessible with custom domain name** - [jakenef.click](https://jakenef.click).

## ðŸš€ HTML deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] **HTML pages** - Four html pages that represent login, playing the game, seeing the leaderboard, and an about section.

- [x] **Links** - In the header there are in-app links and in the footer there is a link to my github.
- [x] **Text** - I used different h tags and p tags to describe what was happening on the play and leaderboard pages. I also used bold and italics in both.
